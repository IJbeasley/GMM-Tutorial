    "\n",
    "Before diving into the Gale–Shapley algorithm, it is important to understand the key terms and concepts used in the algorithm. Below is a list of terms along with their explanations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stable Matching**: A matching is stable if there are no two elements (student \\( s \\) and algorithm \\( a \\)) such that \\( s \\) prefers \\( a \\) over their current match and \\( a \\) prefers \\( s \\) over their current match.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preference List**: A ranking of options in order of preference. In this algorithm:\n",
    "  - Students have a preference list for algorithms.\n",
    "  - Algorithms have a preference list for students.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unmatched**: A student or algorithm that is not yet paired in the current iteration of the matching process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Proposal**: When a student proposes to an algorithm, they express their desire to be matched with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rejection**: An algorithm can reject a proposal if it prefers its current partner or is already matched.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Current Partner**: The student or algorithm that is currently paired with another in the matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Blocking Pair**: A pair \\( (s, a) \\) that would prefer each other over their current matches. A stable matching has no blocking pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **M (Matching)**: The set of all pairs \\( (s, a) \\) in the current state of the algorithm.\n",
